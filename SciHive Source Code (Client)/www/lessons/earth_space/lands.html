        A landform is a natural or artificial feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography.<br><br>

        Philippines is a beautiful country because it has different land and water formations that shaped our country. Here are some land forms in the Philippines:<br><br>


        <h5>Volcano (Bulkan)</h5>
        <img src="Philippines/land2.jpg" width="100%" style="border:3px outset orange"><br><br>
        A volcano is a mountain with a large hole at the top. There are active volcanoes and inactive volcanoes found in the Philippines. We have almost 200 volcanoes, but only 22 volcanoes are active. Mayon volcano is an example of an active volcano. It is located in Bicol province. It is one of the beautiful volcanoes because of its perfect cone. Another example is found in Talisay, Batangas. It is known as Taal Volcano. This is the smallest volcano in the world, and you will be amazed how beautiful it is.<br><br>


        <h5>Hill (Burol)</h5>
        <img src="Philippines/land3.jpg" width="100%" style="border:3px outset orange"><br><br>
        A hill is a high mass of land less than a mountain. It is still a part of a mountain, but it is in the lower part. This land form is used by farmers to graze their cows, goats, and carabaos because of its abundant grass and plants. Chocolate Hill is the famous hill in the Philippines found in Bohol.<br><br>


        <h5>Plain (Kapatagan)</h5>
        <img src="Philippines/land4.jpg" width="100%" style="border:3px outset orange"><br><br>
        A plain is a wide and flat land. Most developed cities in the Philippines are located in a plain land. It is also an ideal place for farming. The plain of Central Luzon is the largest plain in the country. It is also known as the rice granary of the Philippines.<br><br>


        <h5>Mountain (Bundok)</h5>
        <img src="Philippines/land5.jpg" width="100%" style="border:3px outset orange"><br><br>
        Philippines is rich in mountains. Mt. Apo is the highest mountain in the Philippines, and it is located in Davao, Mindanao. The second highest mountain is Mt. Dulang-Dulang found in Bukidnon. The third highest mountain is Mt. Pulag in Benguet. There are four mountain ranges in our country: Sierra Madre Mountains are the longest mountain range; Zambales mountain range;Cordillera mountain range;and Caraballo mountain range.<br><br>


        <h5>Plateau (Talampas)</h5>
        <img src="Philippines/land6.jpg" width="100%" style="border:3px outset orange"><br><br>
        A plateau is a wide plain on top of a hill or mountain. Many farmers lived here because it has a cool weather. It is also ideal for planting and growing vegetables and fruits. Tagaytay City and Baguio City are good examples of beautiful plateau in Philippines.<br><br>


        <h5>Valley (Lambak)</h5>
        <img src="Philippines/land7.jpg" width="100%" style="border:3px outset orange"><br><br>
        A valley is a plain land between the foot of the hills or mountains. Cagayan valley is the largest valley in the country. La Trinidad valley in Benguet is used for planting vegetables and fruits. You can find here different vegetables and fruits.<br><br>


        <h5>Cape (Tangos)</h5>
        <img src="Philippines/land8.jpg" width="100%" style="border:3px outset orange"><br><br>
        A cape is point of land running into the water. Some capes are used for docking sea vessels. Also, some constructions are built for good purposes. An example of a beautiful cape is in Pangasinan. It is called Cape Bolinao. A lighthouse was built there to guide sea travelers.<br><br>

		var line_1 = "Landforms. The Landforms is an archipelago, or string of over 7,100 islands, in southeastern Asia between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The two largest islands, Luzon and Mindanao, make up for two-thirds of the total land area. Only about one third of the islands are inhabited. FAST FACTS. OFFICIAL NAME: Republic of the Landforms. FORM OF GOVERNMENT: Republic. CAPITAL: Manila. POPULATION: 105,893,381. OFFICIAL LANGUAGE: Filipino (based on Tagalog), English. MONEY: Philippine peso. AREA: About 115,831 square miles (300,000 square kilometers). PEOPLE & CULTURE. Filipinos are predominantly of Malay descent, frequently with Chinese and sometimes American or Spanish ancestry. Many Filipinos have Spanish names because of a 19th-century Spanish decree that required them to use Spanish surnames, or last names. Parents often name their children after the saint whose feast day was on the day of their birth. Elementary education in the Landforms starts at age seven, is required by law, and lasts for six years. Secondary education begins at age 13 and lasts for four years; undergraduate college instruction typically is four years. NATURE. The islands are home to many species of flowering plants and ferns, including hundreds of species of orchids. Tall grasses have replaced the forests, which have disappeared due to logging, mining, and development. The Landforms are inhabited by more than 200 species of mammals, including monkeys, squirrels, lemurs, mice, pangolins, chevrotains, mongooses, civet cats, and red and brown deer, among others. The binturong, or Asian bear cat, was once prominent, but now this furry mammal is vulnerable. The tamaraw, a species of small water buffalo found only on Mindoro, is critically endangered. Hundreds of species of birds live in the Landforms, either for all or part of the year, including peacocks, pheasants, doves, parrots, kingfishers, sunbirds, tailorbirds, weaverbirds, and hornbills. The endangered Philippine eagle, which eats monkeys, is barely surviving deforestation. GOVERNMENT. Filipinos elect their president. The president is the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and serves a six-year term. The economy is based on agriculture, light industry, and services. The country produces bananas, rice, coconuts, corn, fish, mangos, pineapples, sugarcane, pork, and beef.";

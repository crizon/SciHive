	<p>In everyday life, we walk, drive cars, and lift objects. All these tasks need a force to be performed. So, it is necessary to understand this force scientifically. This force was described scientifically by Isaac Newton. He described the force and its relationships in his laws that are known today as the Newton's Laws of Motion.

			<h3>First Law of Motion</h3>	
		
	</div>

	<img src="motion2.jpg" width="100%" style="border: 5px outset orange"><br><br>

	<p>
		The first law states that an object in motion will continue to move with same speed in the same direction until another force acts on it. Furthermore, an object which is at rest (not moving) will not move until some external force acts on it.<br><br>

		You may be thinking, how this is possible. Because as you kick a ball, it will immediately start to slow down and will come to rest at a distance. This happens because of air friction. As you kick a ball, frictional forces immediately start to oppose the motion of the ball until it comes to rest.

			<h3>Second Law of Motion</h3>	
		
	</div>

	<img src="motion3.jpg" width="100%" style="border: 5px outset orange"><br><br>

	<p>
		The Second Law states that force is equal to mass times the acceleration. Let's say it in other words, the more force is applied to an object the more acceleration will be produced in it. As a result, the object will speed up faster. For example, if you hit a ball harder, it will go faster and farther.<br><br>

		The Second law of motion can also be defined in the mathematical form. It is defined as, <b>F = mass * acceleration</b>.<br><br>

		<b>F = m*a</b>; m is the mass and "a" is the acceleration

			<h3>Third Law of Motion</h3>	
		
	</div>
	<h6>(Every action has reaction)</h6>

	<img src="motion4.jpg" width="100%" style="border: 5px outset orange"><br><br>

	<p>You may be familiar with the statement of this law which states that "every action has equal and opposite reaction". In other words, each applied force also has the opposing force, which has the same magnitude of applied force but in opposite direction. For example, when you kick a ball with 10 N force, your feet will also experience the same 10 N force from the ball.

	<li>It is said that Isaac Newton got the idea for gravity when an apple fell off a tree and hit him on the head.</li><br>

	<li>Forces are measured in Newtons. This is after Isaac Newton, not fig newtons, even if they are tasty.</li><br>

	<li>Gases and liquids push out in equal forces in all directions. This is called Pascal's Law because it was discovered by the scientist Blaise Pascal.</li><br>

	<li>When you go upside down in a roller coaster loop-the-loop, a special kind of force called "centripetal force" keeps you in your seat and from falling out.</li>

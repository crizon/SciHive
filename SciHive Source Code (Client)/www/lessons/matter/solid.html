	<b>Solid's Physical characteristic</b> - solids can be hard like a rock, soft like fur, a big rock like an asteroid, or small rocks like grains of sand. The key is that <b>solids hold their shape</b> and they don't flow like a <i>liquid</i>. A rock will always look like a rock unless something happens to it. The same goes for a diamond. Solids can hold their shape because their molecules are tightly packed together.
	</p><br>

	<p>
	You might ask, "Is baby power a solid? It's soft and powdery." Baby power is also a solid. It's just a ground down piece of <b>talc</b>. Even when you grind a solid into powder, you will see tiny pieces of that solid under a microscope. Liquids will flow and fill up any shape of container. Solids like to hold their shape.

	<img src="solid/solid 2.jpg" width="100%" style="border: 5px outset orange"><br><br>
	<p>
	In the same way that a large solid holds its shape, the atoms inside of a solid are not allowed to move around too much. <b>Atoms</b> and molecules in liquids and <b>gases</b> are bouncing and floating around, free to move where they want. The molecules in a solid are stuck in a specific structure or arrangement of atoms. The atoms still vibrate and the <b>electrons</b> fly around in their orbitals, but the entire atom will not change its position.

		var line_2 = "What makes a state of matter? It's all about the physical state and energy in the atoms and molecules. Think about solids. Physical properties of a solid often include hard and brittle. Liquids are fluidy, move around a little, and fill up containers. Gases are always around you, but the molecules of a gas are much farther apart than the molecules in a liquid. If a gas has an odor, youâ€™ll often be able to smell it before you can see it. The BEC is all about atoms that are closer and less energetic than atoms in a solid. What is a physical change in matter? Molecules can move from one physical state to another (phase change) and not change their atomic structure. Oxygen (O2) gas has the same chemical properties as liquid oxygen. The liquid state is colder and denser (less energy), but the molecules are the same. Water (H2O) is another example. A water molecule is made up of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. It has the same molecular structure whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid. Although its physical state may change because of different amounts of energy, its atomic structure remains the same. So what is a chemical change in matter? Let's start with that glass of pure water. If the formula of water were to change, that would be a chemical change. If you could add a second oxygen atom to a water (H2O) molecule, you would have hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The molecules would not be water anymore. In reality, there are a variety of steps that go into creating hydrogen peroxide from water. Physical changes are related to changes in the immediate environment such as temperature, pressure, and other physical forces. Chemical changes occur when the bonds between atoms in a compound are created or destroyed. Generally, the basic chemical structure does not change when there is a physical change. Of course, in extreme environments such as the Sun, no molecule is safe from destruction. ";

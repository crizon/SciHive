	<p>
	Before we dive into solutions, let's separate solutions from other types of mixtures. Solutions are groups of molecules that are mixed and evenly distributed in a system. Scientists say that solutions are homogenous systems. Everything in a solution is evenly spread out and thoroughly mixed. Heterogeneous mixtures have a little more of one thing (higher concentration) in one part of the system when compared to another.
	</p><br>

	<p>
	Let's compare sugar in water (H<small>2</small>O) to sand in water. Sugar dissolves and is spread throughout the glass of water. The sand sinks to the bottom. The sugar-water is a homogenous mixture while the sand-water is a heterogeneous mixture. Both are mixtures, but only the sugar-water can also be called a solution.

			<h3> Can anything be in<br> a Solution?</h3>	
		
	</div>

	<p>
	Pretty much. Solutions can be solids <b>dissolved</b> in <i>liquids</i>. When you work with <i>chemistry</i> or even cook in your kitchen, you will usually be dissolving solids into liquids. Solutions can also be gases dissolved in liquids, such as carbonated water. There can also be gases in other <i>gases</i> and liquids in liquids. If you mix things up and they stay at an even distribution, it is a solution. You probably won't find people making solid-solid solutions. They usually start off as solid/gas/liquid-liquid solutions and then harden at room temperature. <i>Alloys</i> with all types of metals are good examples of solid solutions at room temperature.</p><br>

	<h3> Making Solutions</h3>

	<p>
	A simple solution is basically two substances that are evenly mixed together. One of them is called the solute and the other is the solvent. A <b>solute</b> is the substance to be dissolved (sugar). The <b>solvent</b> is the one doing the dissolving (water). As a rule of thumb, there is usually more solvent than solute. Be patient with the next sentence as we put it all together. The amount of solute that can be dissolved by the solvent is defined as <b>solubility</b>. That's a lot of "sol" words.

	</p><br>

	<img src="S_M/SM 3.jpg" width="100%" style="border: 5px outset orange"><br><br>

	<h3>Colloids</h3>
	

	<p>
	 Science has special names for everything. They also have names for the different types of homogenous mixtures. Solution is the general term used to describe homogenous mixtures with small particles. <b>Colloids</b> are solutions with bigger particles. Colloids are usually foggy or milky when you look at them. In fact, milk is an <b>emulsified</b> colloid.
	 <br><br>
	 You may also hear about colloids if you study soil. While milk is an <b>organic</b> colloid, soils can be made up of <b>inorganic</b> colloids, such as clay.
